# DirectX 11 Demo

This is a little research of mine with the aim of learning how graphics programming and game engine development is done. The project uses Microsoft's DirectX 11 API (as opposed to OpenGL, DX12, or Vulkan) for the less steep learning curve and availability of tooling.

# Requirements
- Windows 11 or Windows 10 (update 10.0.17134.0)
- Visual Studio 2022 (should compile fine under 2019)
  - "Universal Windows Platform Development" and "Game Development with C++" workloads

# Running on Xbox One / Xbox Series X|S
As an added benefit from being a UWP, this demo can be deployed and debugged under "Dev Mode" on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S consoles.
